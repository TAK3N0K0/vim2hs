*vim2hs.txt*    Vim to Haskell                                         *vim2hs*

COMMANDS                                                    *vim2hs-commands*

                                                                    *:HPaste*
:{range}HPaste          Paste the contents of the buffer or range
                        to hpaste.org.  Requires a Vim compiled with a
                        |Python| interface.

                        See also |g:hpaste_author|.

                                                                     *:HLint*
:HLint {args}           Run HLint on the buffer.  Requires hlint to be
                        installed and in $PATH.  This actually sets the
                        |:compiler| to "hlint" temporarily, and then restores
                        the |current_compiler|.

                        Only available to Haskell buffers.

                        See also |g:hlint_args|.

                                                                 *:PointFree*
:PointFree              Suggest a pointfree version of the selected code.
                        Requires pointfree (available from Hackage) to be
                        installed and in $PATH.  Accepts a range to make it
                        easier to run from |Visual| mode, but the range is
                        actually ignored.

:PointFree!             Like ":PointFree" but replaces the selection with the
                        suggested pointfree version.

for HSP: >
